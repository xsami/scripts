To run any of the scripts on this directory you must need to have [Windows OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) running on your machine. As well a virtual machine with Windows can be used to run these scripts.


### How to install dependencies ?

I recommend to use `version 10` of Windows as code was tested on this version. To download click [Download Windodows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) and install it on your machine or a virtual machine.
